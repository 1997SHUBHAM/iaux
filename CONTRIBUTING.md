## If you are a developer...

Please read our [Getting Started guide](Getting-Started), which includes local setup instructions and a [tutorial on developing a sample component.](Tutorial-Developing-a-Component)

Then, review our [software development process,](Software-Development-Process) select an issue to work on from the [project board](https://github.com/internetarchive/iaux/projects/1), and dive on in! You'll engage in discussions, submit pull requests, get feedback from the community, and hopefully find your hard work resulting in improvements to how users experience Archive.org.

## If you are a designer...

Please check out our [Design Pattern Library](Design-Pattern-Library) to get a sense of what's currently available on Archive.org, and then when inspiration strikes, head over to our [Design Proposals](Design-Proposals) to see what others have suggested and whether you have something new to contribute.
