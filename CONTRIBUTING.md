## If you are a developer...

Please read our [Getting Started guide](https://github.com/internetarchive/iaux/wiki/Getting-Started), which includes local setup instructions and a [tutorial on developing a sample component.](https://github.com/internetarchive/iaux/wiki/Tutorial-Developing-a-Component)

Then, review our [software development process,](https://github.com/internetarchive/iaux/wiki/Software-Development-Process) select an issue to work on from the [project board](https://github.com/internetarchive/iaux/projects/1), and dive on in! You'll engage in discussions, submit pull requests, get feedback from the community, and hopefully find your hard work resulting in improvements to how users experience Archive.org.

Note that as with any Open Source project, we cannot guarantee that all contributions will result in merged code. In addition to needing to maintain standards of code quality, utility, and maintainability, we are also beholden to our stakeholders, who include both general users and other groups within our organization. Nevertheless, we will do our best to guide development efforts towards projects that will be of value to the site. And we hope that the process will serve you as well!

## If you are a designer...

Please check out our [Design Pattern Library](https://github.com/internetarchive/iaux/wiki/Design-Pattern-Library) to get a sense of what's currently available on Archive.org, and then when inspiration strikes, head over to our [Design Proposals](https://github.com/internetarchive/iaux/wiki/Design-Proposals) to see what others have suggested and whether you have something new to contribute.
